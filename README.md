**CSS Grid and pre-defined useful layouts for Shiny**

With this library it is easy to define custom layouts in Shiny apps using the powerful
**[CSS grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)**.
It also provides a number of ready to use layouts like sidebar layout, vertical layout etc.

It works great together with [shiny.semantic](https://github.com/Appsilon/shiny.semantic), but is compatible with any UI framework.

## How to install?

You can install a stable `shiny.layouts` release from CRAN repository:
